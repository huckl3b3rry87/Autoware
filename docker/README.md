# Autoware Docker


## Install docker
To use Docker, it must be first installed on your machine:
```
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://p80.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 --recv-keys 58118E89F3A912897C070ADBF76221572C52609D

# For Ubuntu 14.04
Repo = "deb https://apt.dockerproject.org/repo ubuntu-trusty main"
# For Ubuntu 16.04
Repo = "deb https://apt.dockerproject.org/repo ubuntu-xenial main"

echo $Repo | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-engine
```

### How to build
Make sure that the file has the appropriate permissions:
```
chmod +x build.sh
```
Then build it with,
```
./build.sh kinetic
```
### How to run
Make sure that the file has the appropriate permissions:
```
chmod +x run.sh 
```

Run it with,
```
febbo@febbo-HP-ZBook-17-G2:~/Documents/workspace/Autoware/docker$ ./run.sh kinetic
```

Now that we have changed users, we can run ``Autoware`` with:
```
autoware@febbo-HP-ZBook-17-G2:~$ cd Autoware/ros/
autoware@febbo-HP-ZBook-17-G2:~/Autoware/ros$ ./run
```
Then car_demo can be launched by clicking on the ``Simulation`` tab and then the ``Gazebo`` tab.

### Notes
To begin the port car_demo into Autoware, and leave the nvidia image base, then the docker files where copied in the car_demo stack. This had to be done, because ros-kinetic does not build with gazebo 8 by default.
